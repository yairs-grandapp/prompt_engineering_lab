  "summary": "On October 05, 2025, the senior used the toilet for urination 2 times, which aligns with the average of 2 visits seen over the past week. While this is consistent, it's worth noting that there has been a slight downward trend in usage recently, as the senior has been gradually using the toilet less often compared to previous weeks. This might be something to keep an eye on, but it's always good to remember that many factors can influence bathroom habits.",
