  "summary": "This week has been quite concerning, particularly regarding personal care and sleep patterns. There was a noticeable decline in hygiene and shower usage, with several days recording no activities at all, which may indicate the need for additional support. Sleep has also been a significant issue, with multiple nights of no recorded sleep, contrasting sharply with previous patterns. On a brighter note, there were some positive movements earlier in the week, showing engagement, but this too has tapered off recently. It's important to closely monitor these changes and consider reaching out for help if these trends continue.",
