  "summary": "On October 06, 2025, the senior did not take a shower, which reflects a noticeable dip compared to the average of about half a shower per day over the past week. This trend of decreasing shower usage has been steady, as the monthly average also shows a slight decline. It might be worth checking in to see if there are any concerns or preferences affecting their self-care routine.",
