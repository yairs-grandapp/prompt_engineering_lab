  "summary": "On October 03, 2025, the senior did not take any showers, which reflects a decline from the average of half a shower per day over the past week. This is part of a gentle downward trend seen in shower usage throughout the month, where the average has been around just over half a shower daily. It's important to keep an eye on these patterns, as changes in personal care routines can sometimes signal other needs or feelings.",
