  "summary": "On October 02, 2025, the senior did not get any sleep, which is quite concerning, especially as it follows a week where sleep patterns were not very consistent. Over the past month, there was an average of about 5.5 hours of sleep each night, indicating a gradual decline in sleep duration recently. It might be helpful to explore any potential reasons behind this change to ensure they get the rest they need.",
