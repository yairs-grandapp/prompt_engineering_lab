  "summary": "On October 06, 2025, the senior did not engage in any movement within the house, which is a significant drop compared to the past week's activity, where they usually spent several hours in motion. This decline is concerning, especially since there was a generally positive trend in movement throughout the month. It's important to keep an eye on this change and check in with the senior to ensure they're feeling well and comfortable.",
