## Weekly Summary

**Period:** 2025-09-05 to 2025-09-09


**Generated Summary:**  

> Overall, the week was mixed — there were some restful nights (over 7 hours on a couple of days) but sleep varied from very short to good, so rest is inconsistent. Personal care also swung from high to low (notably 11 hygiene events on 9/9 but only 3 on 9/8), suggesting routines or assistance changed during the week. Falls were generally lower than the monthly average, which is encouraging, but they climbed toward the end of the week (6 then 8), so that uptick is worrying and worth watching. Keep monitoring daily patterns and consider extra check-ins or simple fall‑prevention steps on days when sleep or hygiene dips — there are positives, but the late-week increase in falls deserves attention.
