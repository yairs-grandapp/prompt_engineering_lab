  "summary": "On September 08, 2025, the senior spent about 38 minutes engaged in movement around the house. While this is a lower duration compared to previous days, it's important to note that the trend over the past week has shown a gradual decrease in movement overall. This gentle decline might suggest a need for some extra support, but it's good to recognize that there have been periods of more active days recently.",
