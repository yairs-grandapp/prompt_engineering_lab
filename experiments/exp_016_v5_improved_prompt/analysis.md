## Overall Daily Summary Accuracy

**Total Errors: 4 out of 15 summaries**
**Accuracy: 73% (27% error rate)**

### Error Breakdown:

1. **Sept 05 Hygiene**: 40% difference but said "consistent with" instead of "above"
2. **Sept 06 Sleep**: 21.5% difference but said "consistent with" instead of "below" + compared to wrong baseline (monthly vs weekly)
3. **Sept 08 Sleep**: 17% difference but said "below" instead of "consistent with"
4. **Sept 08 Falls**: 16% difference but said "below" instead of "consistent with"

### Error Patterns:

- **Threshold boundary errors**: Sept 08 sleep (17%) and falls (16%) are close to 20% boundary
- **Wrong baseline comparison**: Sept 06 sleep compared to monthly instead of weekly
- **Math errors**: Sept 05 hygiene (40% marked as consistent)

## Weekly Summary Analysis

**Generated Summary:**
> This week showed a variety of patterns across different behaviors. Hygiene activities demonstrated a fluctuating pattern, with instances ranging from 3 to 11 times daily, ultimately peaking at the week's end. Sleep duration exhibited a gentle upward trend, moving from around 4 to 7 hours, although there was some daily variation. Falls detected showed a gradual decrease, starting the week with 2 instances and increasing slightly to 8 by the last day, remaining below the monthly average. Overall, the week displayed both increases and decreases across these behaviors, with notable changes in hygiene and falls.

### Critical Error in Weekly Summary:

**Falls Pattern Contradiction:**
- Summary says: "Falls detected showed a gradual decrease"
- Actual data: 2 → 2 → 3 → 6 → 8 (INCREASING!)
- Then contradicts itself: "starting the week with 2 instances and increasing slightly to 8"

This is a **MAJOR FACTUAL ERROR** - the summary claims both "decrease" and "increase" for the same behavior.

### What Went Right:

✓ Hygiene pattern correctly identified as "fluctuating" with range 3-11
✓ Sleep correctly identified as "gentle upward trend"
✓ Specific numbers included (3 to 11, 4 to 7 hours)
✓ Prioritized safety-critical behavior (falls)
✓ No interpretive language used

### What Went Wrong:

✗ Contradictory statements about falls direction
✗ Pattern misidentification (said "decrease" when data shows increase)

## Comparison with Baseline

**Need to compare with exp_012 (V4 daily + V2 weekly) to quantify improvement**

### Expected vs Actual Improvement:

**Daily Summaries:**
- Expected: +10-12% reliability (chain-of-thought reasoning)
- Actual: Unable to calculate without baseline, but still seeing 27% error rate
- Errors persist in: ±20% threshold application, baseline selection, boundary cases

**Weekly Summary:**
- Expected: +12% reliability (synthesis methodology)
- Actual: Major contradiction indicates synthesis process not followed correctly
- The 5-step methodology didn't prevent pattern misidentification

## Recommendations

### For Daily Prompts:

1. **Strengthen comparison rule enforcement**
   - Add explicit calculation example in prompt: "CALCULATE FIRST: |today - avg| / avg * 100"
   - Add validation checkpoint: "Is your percentage calculation correct?"

2. **Clarify baseline priority**
   - Emphasize: "ALWAYS compare to weekly average first unless weekly data unavailable"

3. **Add boundary case guidance**
   - Explicit guidance for values near 20% threshold (15-25% range)

### For Weekly Prompts:

1. **Add pattern validation step**
   - Before writing, verify: "Does start value → end value match your description?"
   - Falls: 2→8 is increase, not decrease

2. **Strengthen STEP 2 of synthesis process**
   - Add: "Calculate: (end_value - start_value). If >0 → increasing. If <0 → decreasing."

3. **Add output validation**
   - Check for contradictions: Don't say "decrease" and "increase" for same behavior

## Cost

**Estimated Cost:** $0.0000
**Daily Summaries:** 15
**Weekly Summaries:** 1

## Next Steps

1. Compare with exp_012 baseline to quantify actual improvement
2. Implement daily prompt v6 with stronger math enforcement
3. Implement weekly prompt v4 with pattern validation
4. Test on larger dataset (50+ cases) including edge cases
