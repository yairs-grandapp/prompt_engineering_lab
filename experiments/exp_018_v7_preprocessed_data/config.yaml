experiment:
  name: "V7 - Preprocessed Data (Hours + Trend Classification)"
  date: "2025-10-15"
  description: |
    Tests if pre-processing the data eliminates calculation errors:
    - Duration stats: average/lastValue converted to hours (not milliseconds)
    - All stats: slope classified into "increasing"/"decreasing"/"stable"
    - Model only needs to do simple arithmetic comparison

    Expected: Should fix the remaining 2 errors from v6 (Sept 05, Sept 06)
    Target accuracy: 95%+ (was 87% in v6)

model:
  name: "gpt-4o"
  temperature: 0.7
